# Object Oriented Programming Assignment 1

Your software development company has been approached by a potential client to develop a card shuffling and dealing application.
The requirements that the client has specified are:
- [x] It should only be one pack of cards.
- [ ] It needs to be used by their other card games.
- [x] The pack of cards should be initialised and created in the Pack constructor.
- [x] The methods should have the following signatures (to fit in with their other software):
    - [x] `public static bool shuffleCardPack(int typeOfShuffle)`
    - [x] `public static Card dealCard()`
    - [x] `public static List<Card> dealCard(int amount)`
- [x] The `typeOfShuffle` should be 1: Fisher-Yates Shuffle  2: Riffle Shuffle  3: No Shuffle

### Testing
- [ ] Create a `class Testing`
    - [ ] Creates a Pack Object
    - [ ] Class the `shuffleCardPack`
    - [ ] call the `deal` method
    - [ ] check what is returned.
